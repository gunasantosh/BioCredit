## Project Overview

The BioGas Data Collection Blockchain App is a web application built with a tech stack that includes:

- **HTML5:** For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS3:** To style and enhance the user interface.
- **Python Flask Framework:** For server-side logic and routing.
- **JavaScript:** To add interactivity and dynamic functionality.
- **Algorand SDK:** Empowering the project with blockchain capabilities.

## Key Features

Our application boasts a range of features designed to simplify and optimize the biogas data collection process:

- **QR Code Scanning:** Seamlessly open the app using QR code scanning.
- **Meter Reading Capture:** Capture images of analog meter readings.
- **Manual Input:** Provide manual input for meter readings.
- **Auto GPS Coordinates:** Automatically capture GPS coordinates for precise location data.
- **Data Upload:** Efficiently upload collected data to the server.

### Additional Functionality for Super Users

Super users have enhanced capabilities to manage and collect data:

- **Select User Account:** Super users can choose a user account to upload data on their behalf.
- **Meter Picture Capture:** Take pictures of meters at the user's location for documentation.
- **Manual Reading Input:** Input manual readings when required.
- **Super User GPS Verification:** Capture the super user's GPS location to verify their physical presence.
- **Data Upload:** Upload data to the server under the selected user account.

## Server Backend

The server backend is robust and capable, with support for:

- **User Accounts:** Manage user accounts for up to 50 locations.
- **Location Registration:** Register location names, usernames, and addresses.
- **Data Storage:** Store uploaded data securely.
