Welcome to the BioGas Data Collection Blockchain App repository! This project was developed as part of the Algorand biogas data collection hackathon, aiming to streamline the process of gathering and storing critical biogas data. Our dedicated team of three talented developers, Satish, Guna, and Sandeep, has crafted this innovative solution using a stack of cutting-edge technologies.

## Project Overview

The BioGas Data Collection Blockchain App is a web application built with a tech stack that includes:

- **HTML5:** For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS3:** To style and enhance the user interface.
- **Python Flask Framework:** For server-side logic and routing.
- **JavaScript:** To add interactivity and dynamic functionality.
- **Algorand SDK:** Empowering the project with blockchain capabilities.

## Key Features

Our application boasts a range of features designed to simplify and optimize the biogas data collection process:

- **QR Code Scanning:** Seamlessly open the app using QR code scanning.
- **Meter Reading Capture:** Capture images of analog meter readings.
- **Manual Input:** Provide manual input for meter readings.
- **Auto GPS Coordinates:** Automatically capture GPS coordinates for precise location data.
- **Data Upload:** Efficiently upload collected data to the server.

### Additional Functionality for Super Users

Super users have enhanced capabilities to manage and collect data:

- **Select User Account:** Super users can choose a user account to upload data on their behalf.
- **Meter Picture Capture:** Take pictures of meters at the user's location for documentation.
- **Manual Reading Input:** Input manual readings when required.
- **Super User GPS Verification:** Capture the super user's GPS location to verify their physical presence.
- **Data Upload:** Upload data to the server under the selected user account.

## Server Backend

The server backend is robust and capable, with support for:

- **User Accounts:** Manage user accounts for up to 50 locations.
- **Location Registration:** Register location names, usernames, and addresses.
- **Data Storage:** Store uploaded data securely.
